This repo is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/munkireport/
Main Differences between main branch and this fork:
1. Clients are idenitfied by their serial number, not mac address. This behavior can be reverted, the methods for mac address filtering still exist
2. Added columns for division and manifest
3. manifest ids set in munkireport are picked up by clients on next run.
